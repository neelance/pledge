Pledge of the Responsible Open Source Contributor
-------------------------------------------------

I am offering my projects under an open source licence, because I want it to be useful for other people. Other people's work will be influenced by my own decisions, so I pledge the following:

- I will respect the time other people put into contributions to my project, for example issue reports and pull requests.

- I realize that a regression causes harm to users of my projects. It lowers the quality of their work and forces them to spend unplanned time on analyzing and resolving the regression. I will address regressions quickly or avoid them in the first place, because I am in a much better position to do so than the users of my project.

- I will keep the project alive. If this is not possible for me any more, I will either actively lead a transition to a new primary maintainer or I will clearly mark my project as abandoned.

**Aside from the pledges above, I offer my work voluntarily and can only invest as much time into the project as I deem available.**
